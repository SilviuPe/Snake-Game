This game is running in the console. The technology used is C++ (good language for optimization). 
That type of game it's good for learning C++ the right way, also a good deep dive into game development. </br>

Run the following commands: </br></br>
```>>> chcp 65001``` This will allow the console to display Unicode symbols</br> </br>
```>>> g++ main.cpp``` This will build the code written in "main.cpp" file</br> </br>
```>>> ./a.exe``` This will run the .exe file
